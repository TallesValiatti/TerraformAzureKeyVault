# Using Azure Key Vault to Store Sensitive Information in Terraform

This repo is about securing secrets, such as connection strings, when creating infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform, Bicep, and Pulumi.

Inspired by the need for secure handling of sensitive information, this post demonstrates how to store secrets in Azure Key Vault and use them within Terraform code. By integrating Azure Key Vault, you can ensure that critical information remains secure while automating infrastructure deployment, enhancing both security and efficiency in your development process.
