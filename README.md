# Using Azure Key Vault to Store Sensitive Information in Terraform

This repo focuses on securing secrets, such as connection strings, when creating infrastructure using IaC tools like Terraform, Bicep, and Pulumi.

The implementation demonstrates how to securely store sensitive information in Azure Key Vault and seamlessly integrate these secrets into Terraform code. By using Azure Key Vault, the solution ensures that critical information is protected throughout the infrastructure deployment process, maintaining security while automating the management of resources.

This approach enhances both the security and efficiency of your development workflow, ensuring that sensitive data is handled correctly in cloud-based environments.
